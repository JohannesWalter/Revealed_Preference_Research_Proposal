Idea: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Topic: Revealed preferences and privacy
    \item Advantage of this approach: connects RP and my field of Digital Econ
    \item Setting: GDPR introduced choice on cookies. Cookies choice depends on framing. This new model in the JPE can factor in framing. We can then derive people's revealed preference for privacy
    \item Data: Collect browsing behavoir from random sample. Requirement: Browser add-on. I can refer to the Paper from the conference.
    \item Model: From the JPE Paper, that's gonna be nice
    \item Intro: Science article, put it in general  context of revealed preference research on privacy. If it doesn't exist yet, great (but unlikely). If it does already exist, I'd wager nobody so far has considered the effects of framing with this new model.
\end{itemize}
