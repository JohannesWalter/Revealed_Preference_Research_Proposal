The basline model is directly adapted from \cite{acquisti2015privacy}.

A decision maker i chooses from a binary decision set $ \textbf{S} = \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace  $ und two possible frames $ D_{i} \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace $. 
We can adapt a notation that is akin to what many researchers prefer to use in a potential outcome setting. $ Y_{i}(0) $ and $ Y_{i}(0) $ denotes then the decision individual i makes under frame $ D_{i} = 0 $ and $ D_{i} = 1 $, respectively.
Decision makers are assumed to have strict ordinal preferences over the set of available options. $ Y^{*}_{i} \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace $ denotes the most preferred option.  


\begin{itemize}
    \item Assumption A1 (Frame seperatbility) For all $ i $, $ Y^*_{i} $ does not depend on $ D $.
\end{itemize}
